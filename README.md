# Decentralized Marketplace

## Project Description
This project is a simple decentralized marketplace implemented using Solidity. It allows users to list products for sale and others to purchase them directly on the Ethereum blockchain using ETH.

## Project Vision
The vision is to build a trustless, peer-to-peer platform for buying and selling goods without intermediaries. Every transaction is recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of fraud.

## Key Features
- List products with name and price
- Purchase products securely using ETH
- Emits events for product listings and purchases
- Ensures seller receives funds upon successful purchase

## Future Scope
- Add product images (via IPFS integration)
- Implement product reviews and ratings
- Include buyer/seller dispute resolution
- Multi-token support (ERC-20, stablecoins)
- Upgradeable contract support with proxy patterns
